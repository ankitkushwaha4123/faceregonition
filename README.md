✅ Updated README.md (VS Code Friendly)
Here’s an improved version that includes VS Code-specific instructions:
# Face Recognition System using OpenCV & KNN

A real-time face recognition project using **OpenCV** and a custom **KNN classifier**, developed in **Python** and run in **VS Code**.

## 💻 How to Run This in VS Code

### 🔧 1. Set Up Environment

Install dependencies:

pip install opencv-python numpy
Ensure your workspace folder includes:

All .py files

haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml

A face_dataset/ folder (will be auto-created)

🚀 2. Steps to Run
▶️ a. Open the Project in VS Code
Launch VS Code.

Go to File > Open Folder → Select your project folder.

Open the Terminal (Ctrl + or View > Terminal).

🧑‍💻 b. Capture Face Data
python face_data.py
Enter the name when prompted.

Face samples will be saved in ./face_dataset/.

Press q to quit capturing.

📷 c. Detect Faces (Testing)

python face_detection.py
🧠 d. Run Face Recognition

python face_recoginition.py
Face will be detected and recognized.

Name appears above detected face.

Press q to exit.

🧠 How It Works
Uses Haar Cascade to detect faces.

Captures multiple face samples.

Flattens them and stores them as .npy arrays.

Recognizes faces in real-time using custom KNN.

📌 Tips
If webcam doesn't open, close other apps using the camera.

Run each script in integrated terminal (Terminal > New Terminal).

Keep all files in the same folder (or update paths accordingly).

Ensure the .npy files are created before running recognition.

### 🛠 VS Code Recommendations

1. **Use Python Extension**  
   Install the [Python extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) for syntax highlighting and linting.

2. **Set Python Interpreter**  
   Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` → Type `Python: Select Interpreter` → Choose your Python environment.

3. **Enable Auto Save**  
   Go to `File > Auto Save` to avoid forgetting to save before running.

4. **Use Integrated Terminal**  
   You don’t need to open external CMD. Run all scripts directly from VS Code terminal.
